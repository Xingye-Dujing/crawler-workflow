"""The run's worker half: one node at a time, durably.

This is the code that owns "what does a node do, and what does its result become" — the
executor dispatch (``execute_node``), the checkpointing walk (``run_node_durable``), the
Stop verdict (``settle_node_as_stopped``) and the memory warning (``note_heavy_result``).
It moved out of ``app.py`` because a Blueprint, the scheduler clock and a future CLI all
need to ask the same question, and the layering says nothing below the composition root may
import it: this module imports ``state``/``stores``/``services``/``engine`` and never ``app``.

Why these four are together: they are one decision chain — dispatch the node, store its rows,
grade the outcome. Splitting them across modules is how a Stop and a failure end up with two
different answers about what the node did.
